# Smartphone libraries

To make things easy, we provide native libraries for smartphones. The following libraries are available and can be found on github:

- [iOS](https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet-ios-lib)
- [Android](https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet-android-lib)

The libraries abstract the communication with the Crownstones. They simplify scanning/search for crownstones, wrap the messages into easy-to-use objects, and provide simple functions to access the functionalities provided on the Crownstones. 

## iOS

You can find more information on the <https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet-ios-lib> repository itself. Summarized, it is written in Swift, it uses Carthage to do dependency management, and there are two parts (one that has to do with providing Bluetooth functions, the other with providing indoor localization methods).

## Android

You can find the code on https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet-android-lib. Summarized, it is written in Kotlin, it uses Gradle for dependency management, and it only has the functions that have to do with Bluetooth.

The following features will be available (some are still in development):

## Commands

- Switch/dim
- Set time
- Factory reset
- Update over the air
- Enable/disable iBeacon
- Enable/disable encryption
- Enable/disable mesh
- Enable/disable continous scanning
- Enable/disable continous high frequency power sampling

## Notified data

This data streams in regularly via a callback.

- Switch state (0-100)
- Power usage (mW)
- Total energy usage (Wh)
- Chip temperature (Â°C)

## Get/set configurations

Configurations that can be read and/or written. 

Note: The enable/disable states can only be set using the corresponding [command](#commands) but they can be read through the config.

- Encryption keys
- ID
- iBeacon UUID, major, minor, RSSI at 1m
- TX power
- Advertisement interval
- Schedule (switch on/off at certain times)
- Toggle switch after Crownstone reboot.
- Continous scanning interval, duration and filter

## Mesh commands

Commands that can be issued to other Crownstones via the mesh. In case a command asks for a return value, the value will be notified via a callback.

- Switch
- Get state (switch state, power usage, energy usage, temperature)
- Get [config](#getset-configurations)
- Set [config](#getset-configurations)
- Enable/disable scanning or high frequency power sampling


## Indoor localization

The **indoor localization** library is a separate library to abstracts and implements the localization. It uses the native bluetooth libraries and the [REST API](/cloud) of the cloud. The localization is based on "rooms". A room should be understand as a certain area that you consider important (and have trained as a separate entity). For example, you can define multiple rooms in a single real-world room.

Features (in development):

- Create room
- Remove room
- Start/stop learning room
- Set room fingerprint
- Get room fingerprint
- Adapt a fingerprint from the cloud to your phone model
- Get current location (room)
- Get nearby rooms
- Get distance to room
- Get predicted next room
- Get location (room) of other users

## Smartphone app

![Fifth image of Example app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crownstone/crownstone-sdk/master/images/crownstone-app-small4.png)

The [Crownstone app](https://github.com/crownstone/CrownstoneApp) (Android and iOS) makes use of these libraries and connects to the REST API as well.
The Crownstone app can be used as starting point to develop your own stand-alone app.
It is written in React Native.
