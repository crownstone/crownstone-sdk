# Crownstone SDK

The Crownstone SDK exists of three parts (in an increasing order of integration):

:cloud: A [REST API](#rest_api) in the cloud

:iphone: Smartphone [libraries](#smartphone_libs)

:crown: The [firmware](#bluenet) on the Crownstones, called Bluenet

# <a name="rest_api"></a>REST API

The cloud is required to setup the Crownstones: keys and IDs will be generated, and locations can be set.
After that, it can be used to add users, so they can also make use of your Crownstones.
The cloud is also used to synchronize data between users, and serves as data storage.
You can read how to use it in the [REST API documentation](REST_API.md).
