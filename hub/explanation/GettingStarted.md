# Asset Tracking (in-network localization)

This document is meant to explain the steps required to setup asset tracking using the Crownstone hub.

## Getting started

First things first. We have to get a hub setup and ready to use. We will do this using the Crownstone app on a smartphone. 
If your hub is already configured and your Crownstones are setup, you can skip this step.

- [Download the Crownstone app to your smartphone](https://crownstone.rocks/app)
- In the app, create a Crownstone account and login.
- In the app, setup all Crownstones you want to use by following the in-app instructions.
- In the app, setup your hub by following the in-app instructions.
